\section{Set Cover}
% In the next recess Greg and his friends were discussing again what
% to play. It was always hard to find games that everybody liked.
% For example, Greg likes to play tables tennis or Duck, Duck, Goose but
% does not want to play soccer. Suddenly Greg had an idea: What about
% making a list of everybody's first and second choice and then 
% finding groups which could play together. His friends agree and
% you can see the result in \cref{tab:game_voting}.
% 
% \begin{table}[ht]
%   \centering
%   \begin{tabular}{l|cccc}
%     & table tennis & Duck, Duck, Goose & soccer & swings \\
%     \hline
%     Greg  & 1 &   &   & 2 \\
%     Joey  & 2 & 1 &   &   \\
%     Susan & 1 &   & 2 &   \\
%     Bella &   &   & 2 & 1 \\
%     Jenny & 1 & 2 &   &   \\
%     Jason &   &   & 1 & 2 \\
%     Alice &   & 2 &   & 1 \\
%     Bob   &   & 1 & 2 &   \\
%   \end{tabular}
%   \caption{\label{tab:game_voting}Voting of Greg and his friends}
% \end{table}

% Then Greg went to Mrs. Lloyd and asked her how they could find the 
% best solution. Firstly, she made another list
% (\cref{tab:example_set_cover}) where she put all the children's
% names for each game and summed up their preferences.%
% \footnote{Note that I cheated here: Usually you would divide the
% sum of preferences by the number of children who want to play the
% game. But Greg did not know yet how to divide, so I made all the
% groups have equal size.}

% \begin{table}[ht]
%   \centering
%   \begin{tabular}{lc}
%     table tennis (Greg, Joey, Susan, Jenny): & 4 \\
%     Duck, Duck, Goose (Joey, Jenny, Alice, Bob): & 6 \\
%     soccer (Susan, Bella, Jason, Bob):       & 7 \\
%     swings (Greg, Bella, Jason, Alice):      & 6 \\
%   \end{tabular}
%   \caption{\label{tab:example_set_cover}Summed up preferences for each game}
% \end{table}

% Mrs. Lloyd showed the children that there were no two games to cover
% all of them --- so they needed to split up into at least three groups.
% The best way to do so was to play table tennis, Duck, Duck, Goose, and
% on the swings. That was everybody's first choice besides for Jason.
% The problem Mrs. Lloyd solved is an instance of the minimum weight 
% set cover problem.

\begin{problem}[Minimum Weight Set Cover]\label{prob:mwsc}
  \hfill
  \begin{labeling}{\hspace{4em}}
    \item[\textbf{Given:}]
      A ``universe'' (set) of objects \(U\), 
      subsets \(S = \{S_i\}\)
      such that \(\bigcup\limits_{S_i \in S} S_i = U\),
      and a weight function \(c : S \to \gls{R}_+\)
    \item[\textbf{Sought:}]
      A set \(R \subseteq S\)
      which covers the universe, i.e. 
      \(\bigcup\limits_{S_i \in R} S_i = U\)
      and minimizes \(\sum\limits_{S_i \in R} c(S_i)\)
  \end{labeling}
\end{problem}

\Cref{prob:mwsc} is NP-hard \cite{set_cover} and the related decision 
problem was already one of the problems Karp has shown to be 
NP-complete \cite{set_cover_decision}.
